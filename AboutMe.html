    <p>Hi! I am Jasmin Vi√±as Delos Santos, 20 years old. I am currently a third year BSIT student in Polytechnic University of the Philippines. I am not a dog lover, but my heart is too soft for them. I own two dogs. The first one is Marga, she is a 2 year old shih tzu and the second  one is Mocca, 5 month old american bully. It is actually stressful to take care of them, but they are my reason why I am still choosing to keep on going in life.  </p>
