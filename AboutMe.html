    <p>Hi! I'm Jasmin Vi√±as Delos Santos, a 20-year-old third-year BSIT student at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. For my first simple HTML page, I decided to dedicate it to something I absolutely adore: dogs. Although I don't consider myself as a dog lover, my heart is undeniably tender towards them. In fact, I have the joy of being a proud owner of two dogs. The first one is Marga, a stubborn but loveable 2-year-old Shih Tzu, and the second is Mocca, a very sweet 5-month-old American Bully. Taking care of them can sometimes be challenging, but they are the driving force that keeps me motivated in life.  </p>
